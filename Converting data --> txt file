Use CoolTerm.Exe under "CoolTermWin64Bit".
Configure the settings and select the correct serial port number.
Then go under connection --> Capture to text/binary file --> press Start
Save the file into a name that makes sense!! (This file name has to match with the code in python)
Press Connect and then start the code in Arduino. After you got enough data press disconnect
Now that the data is saved onto the file it must now be coded in python for it to be effectively displayed.
